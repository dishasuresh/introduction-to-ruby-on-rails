It is time to do some real action.
Let us set some expectations

##### What is a User Story

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

> As an API user, when I send a request to /api/v1/books.json, I should be able to get a books json data

I have the json format defined here already which is like:

[books.json](json/books.json)

Now we have expectation set. Let us start developing the applicaiton.
