1) Now modify the spec to test other cases

expect(response.status).to eq(200)
response_body = JSON.parse(response.body)
expect(response_body.first.keys).to eq(["id", "name", "author", "isbn", "description"])

2) Add  binding.pry to Gemfile and prove that the books json is empty

Can any one tell me why is the json empty ?
Because we dont have any books in database.
Let us add some

3) Add few books and run. it will now show
RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError:
expected: ["id", "name", "author", "isbn", "description"]
     got: ["id", "name", "author", "isbn", "description", "created_at", "updated_at"]

4) Show the migration which we have created for books.
open Schema.rb. show the t.timestamps there

# Instance Methods

# Exclude some attributes info from json output.
def as_json(options={})
  options[:except] = [:created_at, :updated_at]
  super(options)
end
